  - 1 cup measuring cup

directions:
  - Preheat oven 350 degrees F.  
  - Spray baking sheet with a little bit of cooking oil, or lay down oven safe parchment/baking paper.
  - Combine all ingredients in large mixing bowl.
  - Using your hands, form nuggets or “poppers” (1/4 inch-1/2 inch thick).
  - Put nuggets on baking sheet.
  - Bake for 25 minutes, flipping halfway.
  - Remove from oven and serve with your favorite dipping sauce.
  - If you want them to be a bit more crisp, put them under the broiler for about 3 minutes, or crisp them up on a fry pan over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes on each side.
storing:
  - Store in refrigerator for 2-3 days.
freezing:
  - Cool cooked nuggets completely.
  - Put the whole sheet pan in freezer for 20 minutes.
  - Transfer to freezer bag/container.
additional notes:
  - If the chicken is too sticky to form, you can place the mixing bowl into the fridge for 20-30 minutes. This will help to make it easier to work with when forming it into the nuggets.
