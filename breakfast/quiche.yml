materials:

  - rolling pin
  - standing mixer
  - measuring cup
  - cutting board & knife
  - optional: toppings like extra cheese, chopped herbs, hollandaise sauce, & freshly ground pepper to taste
directions:
  - Prepare pie crust before you start the quiche. 
  - On a floured work surface, roll out one of the disks of chilled dough. Make a 12 inch in diameter circle. 
  - Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is completely smooth. 
  - To make a lovely edge, I do not trim excess dough around the edges. Instead, fold the excess dough back over the edge and use your hands to mold the edge into a rim around the pie. Crimp the edges with a fork or use your fingers to flute the edges. 
  - Chill the pie crust in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 5 days. 
  - Cover the pie crust with plastic wrap if chilling for longer than 30 minutes. 
  - While the crust is chilling, preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
  - Partially blind bake: Line the chilled pie crust with parchment paper. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Make sure the weights are evenly distributed around the pie dish. 
  - Bake until the edges of the crust are starting to brown, about 15-16 minutes. Remove pie from the oven and carefully lift the parchment paper (with the weights) out of the pie. 
  - Prick holes all around the bottom crust with a fork. 
  - Return the pie crust to the oven. Bake until the bottom crust is just beginning to brown, about 7-8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.
  - Reduce oven temperature to 350°F (177°C).
  - In a large bowl with a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs, whole milk, heavy cream, salt, and pepper together on high speed until completely combined, about 1 minute. Whisk in add-ins and then pour into crust.
  - Bake the quiche until the center is just about set, about 45-55 minutes. Do NOT over-bake. Use a pie crust shield to prevent the pie crust edges from over-browning. 
  - Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Top with optional toppings before slicing and serving, if desired. Or you can cool the quiche completely before serving.
storing:
  - This quiche makes great leftovers! Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
freezing:
  - cover tightly with a couple sheets of aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or on the counter, then bake at 350°F (177°C) for 20-25 minutes.
