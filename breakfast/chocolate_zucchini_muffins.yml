materials:
  - paper towel
  - box grater
  - 1 tsp measuring spoon
  - 1/4 cup measuring cup
  - microwavable ramekin to melt butter
  - muffin pans
  - optional: muffin liners
directions:
  - Preheat oven 375 degrees F (390 degrees at Reno, NV).
  - Coat muffin pans with nonstick spray. Muffin liners optional.
  - In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
  - Grate zucchini with a box grater and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with your hands. (I usually place it onto a clean kitchen towel and roll up to remove excess moisture, too.) 
  - Measure out 1 cup after this process.
  - To a medium bowl, add the zucchini, milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla. Whisk to combine.
  - Gently stir in flour mixture. 
  - Gently stir in the chocolate chips (or blueberries).
  - Divide batter among the prepared muffin pan, using a heaping Â¼ cup in each. I fill them up to the top. Makes roughly 13 muffins.
  - Bake for 16-18 minutes (16 minutes was perfect at Reno, NV), or until a cake tester inserted into the center of each muffin comes out clean.
  - Let cool for a minute or two in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
storing:
  - Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days or in the fridge for up to 5. 
freezing:
  - Freeze cooled muffins in an airtight zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months.
additional notes:
  - Mini Muffins: Cook for 12-14 minutes in a 24-cup mini muffin pan.
  - I adjusted the recipe so that it takes more baking soda. I accidentally did 1 tsp and they came out nice and fluffy.
  - They do really well in silicone liners. Don't need to grease them at all.
  - You can add much more chocolate chips.
