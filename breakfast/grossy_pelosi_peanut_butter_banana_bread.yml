hardware:
  - Loaf Pan
  - Handmixer with parts
  - Large Mixing Bowl
  - Butter Knife to level flour
  - Masher
  - Â½ Measuring Cup
  - 1 tsp Measuring Spoon
  - Microwaveable ramekin
  - Optional: knife and cutting board for chocolate
  - Optional: small bowl, whisk, 1/4 measuring cup, 1/2 tsp measuring spoon for peanut butter frosting
directions:
  - Preheat oven 365 degrees (350 sea level)..
  - In a large bowl, roughly mix granulated sugar, brown sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract. 
  - Add eggs and mashed bananas. Combine. 
  - Mix in all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. 
  - Optional: chop chocolate bar and add in or add in chocolate chips.
  - Oil loaf pan and line it with sheet of parchment so that there are extra flaps over the long side of the pan. Easier to pull out the loaf.
  - Pour batter into loaf pan, spreading it evenly. 
  - Place in oven for 60 minutes (sea level 50-60 minutes) or until a knife comes cleanly out of the bread. 
  - Remove from oven and let cool. 
  - Optional: Make the frosting...whisk together smooth peanut butter and vanilla extract. Add confectioner's sugar and water, little by little, until you reach a desired consistency. Frost once bread is cooled and sprinkle sea salt on top.
storing:
  - Airtight container or bag to keep it fresh. 
freezing:
  - Freeze unfrosted tightly wrapped to avoid freezer burn. To defrost, leave on the counter top overnight and then frost. 
additional notes:
  - This recipe can be made in a 9x9 inch pan or in muffin/cupcake tins. Both will require shorter bake times than the loaf pan, so keep an eye on the oven and stop when your testing knife comes out cleanly!
