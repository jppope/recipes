materials:
  - cutting board
  - knife
  - blender
  - measuring cup 
  - 1/4 cup measuring cup
  - 1 cup measuring cup
  - 1 tablespoon
  - 1 tsp measuring spoon
  - microwavable ramekin to melt butter
  - muffin pans
  - optional: muffin liners
directions:
  - Preheat oven 375 degrees F (390 degrees in Reno, NV).
  - Coat muffin pans with nonstick spray. Muffin liners optional.
  -  Place all ingredients into a blender except the flour and chocolate chips, if using.
  - Blend until very smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowls as needed. You want the greens to be very finely blended in so the batter is green, as if you were making a smoothie.
  - Pulse in the flour just to combine, or stir it in gently.
  - Optional: stir in some mini chocolate chips.
  - Fill each cup in muffin tin about 3/4 cup full. Use an ice cream scoop or dump in piping bag and pipe the batter into the muffin tin cups.
  - Sprinkle mini chocolate chip on top.
  - Bake for 18-20 minutes (16 min in Reno, NV) or until firm to the touch and lightly browned around the edges.
  - Transfer immediately to cooling rack.
storing:
  - Store the muffins in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-5 days and eat cold or slightly warmed. 
freezing:
  - Freeze cooled muffins in an airtight zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months.
additional notes:
  - Mini Muffins:To make as mini muffins, use a 24-cup mini muffin pan and bake for 12-14 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out cleanly.
